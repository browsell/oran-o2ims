Metal3 Controller Test Suite

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the Metal3 hardware management plugin controllers.
The tests validate controller functionality, resource management, and integration with Kubernetes APIs.

TEST FILES AND COVERAGE:

1. AllocatedNode Controller Tests (metal3_allocatednode_controller_test.go):
   - Basic reconciliation flow with AllocatedNode lifecycle management
   - Finalizer management (addition/removal during create/delete operations)
   - BMH (BareMetalHost) allocation and deallocation workflows
   - Error handling for client operations and network failures
   - Controller setup and configuration validation
   - Resource reference validation and cleanup processes
   - Context cancellation and logging functionality
   - Resource version conflict handling

2. BareMetalHost Manager Tests (baremetalhost_manager_test.go):
   - BMH status and allocation management
   - BMH grouping by resource pools and availability filtering
   - Network interface management from hardware details
   - Metadata and annotation operations (labels, annotations)
   - BMH lifecycle operations and permission management
   - Node to BMH relationship management
   - PreprovisioningImage label handling
   - BMC information processing

3. Hardware Plugin Setup Tests (metal3_hardwareplugin_setup_test.go):
   - SetupMetal3Controllers function structure validation
   - Reconciler creation and field assignment verification
   - Error handling and message formatting
   - Namespace parameter handling and validation
   - Logger configuration for different controller types
   - Manager integration and setup verification

4. Helper Function Tests (helpers_test.go):
   - Configuration annotation management (set/get/remove operations)
   - Node finding functions for progress tracking and updates
   - String slice utility functions
   - AllocatedNode creation and status derivation
   - Node allocation request processing
   - Allocation status checking and validation

5. Inventory Management Tests (inventory_test.go):
   - Resource information extraction from BMH objects
   - Admin state, description, and asset ID handling
   - Group parsing from annotations
   - Label and memory extraction from hardware details
   - CPU, network interface, and storage device processing
   - Hardware profile and resource pool management
   - Error handling for missing or malformed data

6. Host Firmware Components Tests (hostfirmwarecomponents_manager_test.go):
   - Firmware component status management
   - Component update tracking and validation
   - Error handling for firmware operations
   - Integration with BMH firmware data

7. Host Firmware Settings Tests (hostfirmwaresettings_manager_test.go):
   - Firmware settings configuration management
   - Settings validation and application
   - Error handling for invalid settings
   - BMH firmware settings integration

8. Host Update Policy Tests (hostupdatepolicy_manager_test.go):
   - Update policy management and enforcement
   - Policy validation and application logic
   - Error handling for policy conflicts
   - Integration with BMH update workflows

TESTING FRAMEWORK:
- Uses Ginkgo v2 BDD testing framework with Gomega assertions
- Fake Kubernetes clients for isolated unit testing
- Mock implementations for error injection scenarios
- Comprehensive setup/teardown with proper resource initialization
- Context handling and cancellation testing capabilities

KEY VALIDATION AREAS:
- Resource lifecycle management (create, update, delete operations)
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Kubernetes API integration and client operations
- Controller reconciliation loops and requeue behavior
- Finalizer and metadata management
- Hardware abstraction and resource mapping
- Network and storage configuration handling
- Firmware and update management workflows

COVERAGE METRICS:
- 100+ individual test cases across all controller components
- Positive and negative path testing scenarios
- Integration-style testing with fake clients
- Error injection and edge case validation
- Helper function unit testing
- Controller setup and configuration verification

Test Cases Description for Metal3 Server Package

This test suite covers comprehensive unit testing for the Metal3 hardware plugin server
implementation, including inventory server, provisioning server, and serve function components.

=== INVENTORY SERVER TESTS (inventory_server_test.go) ===

1. Metal3PluginInventoryServer Constructor Tests:
   - Valid Parameters:
     • should create a Metal3PluginInventoryServer successfully
     • should properly initialize all fields (HubClient, Logger)
     • should return the correct type (*Metal3PluginInventoryServer)
   - Nil Parameters Handling:
     • should handle nil client gracefully
     • should handle nil logger gracefully
     • should handle both nil client and logger gracefully
   - Return Value Validation:
     • should return a pointer to Metal3PluginInventoryServer
     • should never return an error in current implementation

2. Interface Compliance Tests:
   - should implement inventory.StrictServerInterface correctly
   - should be assignable to StrictServerInterface without errors
   - should satisfy the interface at compile time

3. GetResourcePools Method Tests:
   - Successful Operation:
     • should call metal3ctrl.GetResourcePools with correct parameters
     • should use the correct context when calling GetResourcePools
   - Method Signature Validation:
     • should have the correct method signature matching interface requirements

4. GetResources Method Tests:
   - Successful Operation:
     • should call metal3ctrl.GetResources with correct parameters
     • should use the correct context and logger when calling GetResources
   - Method Signature Validation:
     • should have the correct method signature matching interface requirements

5. Embedded InventoryServer Tests:
   - should have the embedded InventoryServer properly initialized
   - should allow access to embedded methods through composition

6. Thread Safety Tests:
   - should be safe to create multiple servers concurrently

7. Memory Management Tests:
   - should not cause memory leaks with multiple instantiations
   - should properly handle server cleanup

8. Method Delegation Tests:
   - should properly delegate GetResourcePools to metal3ctrl package
   - should properly delegate GetResources to metal3ctrl package

=== PROVISIONING SERVER TESTS (provisioning_server_test.go) ===

1. Metal3PluginServer Constructor Tests:
   - Basic Functionality:
     • should create a server successfully with valid parameters
     • should implement the StrictServerInterface
     • should properly initialize all embedded struct fields
   - Metal3-Specific Configuration:
     • should set the correct Metal3-specific configuration
     • should set the Metal3ResourcePrefix constant correctly
     • should set the correct Hardware Plugin ID
   - Parameter Combinations:
     • should work with a nil logger
     • should work with empty config
     • should work with nil client
   - Interface Compliance:
     • should implement provisioning.StrictServerInterface at compile time
   - Field Initialization:
     • should initialize all fields in the correct order

=== SERVE FUNCTION TESTS (serve_test.go) ===

1. Function Behavior and Error Handling:
   - should fail early when not in Kubernetes environment
   - should validate that required dependencies are checked

2. Server Lifecycle Tests:
   - should start and shutdown gracefully (Integration test)
   - should handle signal-based shutdown (Integration test)

3. Configuration Validation Tests:
   - should return error when TLS cert file doesn't exist (Integration test)
   - should return error when TLS key file doesn't exist (Integration test)
   - should return error when address is invalid

4. Server Component Initialization Tests:
   - should handle inventory server creation errors (Integration test)
   - should handle provisioning server creation errors (Integration test)

5. Context Handling Tests:
   - should return immediately without starting server when context is already cancelled

6. Server Startup Error Tests:
   - should return error when port is already in use (Integration test)

7. HTTP Request Handling Tests:
   - should serve requests on the configured endpoints (Integration test)

8. Edge Cases and Error Scenarios:
   - should handle multiple rapid cancellations gracefully (Integration test)
   - should handle timeout during server startup (Integration test)

=== TEST FRAMEWORK ===

The tests use Ginkgo BDD framework with Gomega matchers and include:
- Mock objects for external dependencies (client.Client, logger)
- Context management for cancellation testing
- Temporary file creation for TLS certificate testing
- Thread safety verification with concurrent goroutines
- Memory management validation with multiple instantiations
- Interface compliance verification at both runtime and compile time

=== INTEGRATION VS UNIT TESTS ===

Many tests are marked as "Integration test" and are skipped when not running in a
Kubernetes environment. These tests require:
- Proper Kubernetes configuration
- Access to required services and APIs
- TLS certificate validation
- Network port binding capabilities
- Signal handling functionality

Unit tests focus on constructor validation, interface compliance, parameter handling,
and basic functionality without external dependencies.
